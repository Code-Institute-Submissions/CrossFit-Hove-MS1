# CrossFit Hove Gym Static Website

This project was created for my Milestone 1 project for the Code Institute's Full Stack Dev course. 

I chose to make this site for the local CrossFit gym I use. The gym's existing site lacks content for existing members and potential new clients. The site I have designed is one page and encorporates the overview of the gym, it's ethos, motivational videos, a gallery of members, contact, location and social feeds

I've added nav functionality to link the booking site for existing members and purchasing memberships for new clients. This gives both sides of the target audience usability. 


## UX
 
The user experience was designed to predominantly attract new members to the gym but provide some functionality to existing members. It is a one page website so the user only has to scroll down to be lead through the content. The layout is logical and answers questions as you scroll down. This starts with what classes the gym provides, with a motivational video, followed by a gallery of members. The gallery showcases a broad range of photos of different sexes and ages to be all inclusive and show the membership is diverse. This project achieves it's goal by giving all the information and ability for new members to sign up. It also provides content (social and booking links) for existing members. 

The landing hero image starts the user on the UX journey and shows the site is professional. Next the site has 3 pieces and info on the gym, it's classes and their scope. These are kept to a single paragraph to keep the user engaged. 

A motivational vidoe is embedded to draw people in followed by a gallery of members working out. 

The pricing comes next with unique features set out for each class of membership. These clear pricing cards set out features that should define what propective new clients get for their money. 

The footer section added 3 pieces of functionality, the 'Contact Us' box for all general enquiries, google map for locating the gym and the social feeds taking users to external social networks. 

I feel the one page approach keeps the user engaged rather than a multiple pages where you could easily get lost and lose interest. 

Researching competitor websites showed that this one page UX was predominantly used for this business type.



### Typical User Stories

**Prospective Members**

- As a prospective new member you want to find out about the gym, it's classes and pricing. You can see all information as you scroll down the page or can use the nav links in the header to jump to the relevant section of interest.

- As a prospective new member you want to ask a general question not answered by the sites content. Jump to the Contact form and type your message without creating an email for you personal account. 

**Existing Members**

- As an existing member I want to book a class. I find the booking link easily from the Nav bar and book in to the class

- As an existing member I want to follow the gyms social feeds. I can link to them from the Nav bar

## Features

# Nav Bar

- The nav bar loacted at the top of the page is well spaced and contrasts against the black background making it easy to read. Each link jumps the user to the relevant section making all information easy to find. 

# Hero Image 

- The Hero image welcomes the user with a great visual of a woman lifting weights. This will landing will give the first impression 

# About Us 

- The about us section gives 3 paragraphs of information on the 

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
